## About this project ðŸ“Œ
In this React project, I have created a classic Tic Tac Toe game application. While the primary <br>
state management was handled using the useState hook, the development process involved implementing <br>
various advanced concepts and adhering to best practices in software development. <br><br>

Key Features:<br><br>

- Functional Components: Utilizing React functional components, I structured the application to <br>
maintain a clean and modular codebase, enhancing maintainability and readability.<br><br>

- State Management with useState: The useState hook was employed to manage the game state efficiently. <br>
This allowed for seamless updates to the game board and player turns without the need for complex state management libraries.<br><br>

- Logic Implementation: All game logic, including determining winning conditions, detecting draws, <br>
and tracking player moves, was implemented from scratch. This required careful consideration of <br>
algorithmic efficiency and logical correctness.<br><br>

- Event Handling: Utilizing event handling in React, I facilitated player interactions with the game board, <br>
allowing for intuitive and responsive gameplay.<br><br>

- Component Reusability: Through component composition and reusability, I structured the application to <br>
promote code reuse and scalability. This facilitates future enhancements and modifications to the game app.<br><br>

Conclusion:<br><br>

In summary, this React project demonstrates proficiency in using fundamental React concepts while incorporating <br>
advanced techniques and adhering to best practices in software development. The Tic Tac Toe game app provides an<br>
engaging and interactive experience for users, showcasing a culmination of skills in frontend development.<br>
